## Security Considerations

- API keys are encrypted at rest
- All external API calls use HTTPS
- Input validation is performed on all commands

## Performance

- Average response time: < 1 second
- Memory usage: < 50MB
- Supports concurrent requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Invalid**: Ensure your API key is correctly configured
2. **Timeout Errors**: Increase the timeout setting if needed
3. **Voice Commands Not Working**: Check voice command patterns match
