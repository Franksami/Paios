# Personal AI Operating System - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Product Name**: Personal AI Operating System (PAIOS)  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Target Launch**: Q2 2025  
**Team**: Solo Developer + Claude Code Assistant  

## Executive Summary

Build a minimalist portfolio website that secretly functions as a unified AI workspace. Each numbered accordion item connects to specialized AI agents, creating a self-modifying personal operating system with voice control, real-time visualization, and complete transparency into system operations.

## Problem Statement

Current productivity landscape forces users to:
- Context switch between 15+ different tools and dashboards
- Manage separate logins, APIs, and configurations across platforms
- Lack transparency into how tools connect and share data
- Cannot easily automate cross-platform workflows
- Have no unified voice control over their digital life

## Solution Overview

A single, beautiful interface where each numbered item (1-33+) represents a specialized AI agent that can:
- Perform specific tasks (invoicing, research, social media management)
- Communicate with other agents automatically
- Be controlled via voice commands
- Show live system architecture and data flows
- Modify itself in real-time based on user needs

## Target Users

### Primary: "Vibemarket" Users (Non-technical)
- Entrepreneurs and creators who want to 10x their productivity
- People who hate switching between multiple tools
- Users who prefer natural language over complex interfaces
- Individuals seeking unified control over their digital presence

### Secondary: "Vibecode" Users (Technical)
- Developers who want to understand MCP agent architecture
- Technical users who appreciate system transparency
- People who want to build custom agents and workflows
- Users who value self-documenting, modifiable systems

## User Stories

### Core User Journeys

**Story 1: Instant Social Media Update**
- As a creator, I want to update my TikTok bio by saying "Update my TikTok bio to mention my new project"
- The system should route this to Agent #8, authenticate with TikTok's API, and update immediately
- I should see confirmation and be able to verify the change

**Story 2: Research to Publication Pipeline**
- As a content creator, I want to research a topic and automatically publish findings
- I tell Agent #18 "Research the latest AI agent trends and publish a summary"
- The research agent gathers data, formats it, and Agent #29 publishes to my blog
- I can see the workflow happening in real-time through Agent #31

**Story 3: Business Intelligence Dashboard**
- As an entrepreneur, I want to see my financial health at a glance
- Agent #1 shows revenue, active projects, overdue invoices, and upcoming payments
- When milestones are hit, Agent #15 automatically generates and sends invoices
- All connected through voice: "Show me this month's revenue and send overdue invoices"

**Story 4: System Architecture Learning**
- As a user, I want to understand how my agents work together
- Agent #31 shows live Mermaid diagrams of data flows between agents
- I can click connections to see API calls, modify workflows visually
- The system teaches me about dependencies, inheritance, and architecture patterns

**Story 5: Password and Identity Management**
- As a security-conscious user, I want unified access to all my accounts
- Agent #32 stores all passwords encrypted with biometric access
- Other agents authenticate automatically using stored credentials
- Voice command: "Add my new Instagram API key" updates the vault and enables Agent #8
